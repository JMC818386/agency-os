# Gem Installation Guide

This folder contains the **exact configurations** to create your AI Agency using Google Gems.

## Instructions
1. Open [Gemini Gems Manager](https://gemini.google.com/gems).
2. Click **"New Gem"**.
3. Open the file corresponding to the agent you want to build (e.g., `01_MANAGER_GEM.md`).
4. **Copy & Paste** the 3 sections into the corresponding fields in the Gemini Form:
   - **Name**
   - **Description**
   - **Instructions** (This is the most important part)
5. **Knowledge (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - In the "Knowledge" section of the Gem form, click **"Add files"** -> **Drive**.
   - Select the `AI_AGENCY` folder from your Google Drive (specifically the `MASTER_STATUS_LEDGER.csv` and `_SYSTEM` folder if possible).
   - *Note: If you haven't uploaded this folder to Drive yet, drag the entire `AI_AGENCY` folder from your desktop to Google Drive first.*

## The Order of Creation
Create the **Manager Gem** first.
Then create the **Sub-Agents** as you need them.
