# Project Brief: UPS Global Supply Chain Logistics

**Client:** UPS Supply Chain Solutions
**Project Type:** Enterprise Dashboard (Internal)
**Objective:**
Build a "command center" for global logistics managers to visualize shipping lanes, detect delays, and re-route cargo in real-time.

## 1. Core Features
- **Global Map:** Interactive WebGL globe visualization of all active air, ocean, and ground shipments.
- **Delay Prediction:** AI-driven alerts for potential delays (weather, strikes, customs).
- **Route Optimization:** "What-if" scenario planning tool (e.g., "What if we switch from Suez to Cape route?").
- **KPI Dashboard:** Real-time metrics for On-Time Performance (OTP) and Cost Per Kilo.

## 2. Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + deck.gl (for high-performance map).
- **Backend:** Node.js + GraphQL (for flexible data querying).
- **Data:** Should ingest mock JSON data representing thousands of shipping containers.

## 3. Design Aesthetic
- **Brand:** UPS Brown (#351C15) and Gold (#FFB500).
- **Style:** Professional, Data-Dense, High-Contrast.
- **Layout:** Collapsible sidebar, maximize map area.

## 4. Deliverables
- `Analysis.md`: Competitor and feasibility analysis.
- `Wireframes.json`: Structure of the dashboard.
- `Mockups.png` (or CSS): Visual style guide.
- `Codebase`: Functional React app skeleton.
