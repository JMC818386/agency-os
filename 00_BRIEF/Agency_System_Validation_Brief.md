# PROJECT BRIEF: Agency System Validation

## 1. Overview
The objective is to validate the operational readiness of the Multi-Agent AI Agency Operating System. We will perform a dry-run of a simple project to ensure all agents, file structures, and protocols are functioning correctly.

## 2. Objectives
- Verify File Structure exists.
- Verify System Prompts are accessible.
- Verify Ledger is writable.
- execute a "Hello World" chain: Research -> UX -> Engineering -> QA.

## 3. Scope
**In Scope:**
- Creation of validation artifacts.
- Update of the Master Status Ledger.
- Simple HTML proof of concept.

**Out of Scope:**
- Full complex web app (this is just the system test).
- External API calls (simulated if needed).

## 4. Timeline
- Immediate execution.

## 5. Success Criteria
- A "System Readiness Report" (QA) confirming all gates passed.
