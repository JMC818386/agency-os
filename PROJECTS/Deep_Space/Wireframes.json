To create a structural wireframe JSON for an application, I'll need some basic information about the application such as its main features, user interface components, and navigation structure. Since I don't have the project brief, I'll outline a general structure which you can adapt once you have specific details.

Here is an example JSON structure that represents a basic wireframe of a generic application:

```json
{
  "application": {
    "name": "SampleApp",
    "pages": [
      {
        "name": "Home",
        "type": "landing",
        "components": [
          {
            "type": "header",
            "content": "Welcome to SampleApp"
          },
          {
            "type": "navigation",
            "items": ["Home", "About", "Services", "Contact"]
          },
          {
            "type": "carousel",
            "items": [
              "image1.jpg",
              "image2.jpg",
              "image3.jpg"
            ]
          },
          {
            "type": "footer",
            "content": "© 2023 SampleApp"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "About",
        "type": "information",
        "components": [
          {
            "type": "header",
            "content": "About Us"
          },
          {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "content": "SampleApp is a leading platform for..."
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Services",
        "type": "list",
        "components": [
          {
            "type": "header",
            "content": "Our Services"
          },
          {
            "type": "list",
            "items": [
              "Consulting",
              "Development",
              "Support"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Contact",
        "type": "form",
        "components": [
          {
            "type": "header",
            "content": "Contact Us"
          },
          {
            "type": "form",
            "fields": [
              {
                "type": "text",
                "name": "name",
                "placeholder": "Your name"
              },
              {
                "type": "email",
                "name": "email",
                "placeholder": "Your email"
              },
              {
                "type": "textarea",
                "name": "message",
                "placeholder": "Your message"
              },
              {
                "type": "submit",
                "value": "Send"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In this JSON structure:
- Each page in the application has a name, type, and a collection of components.
- Components can include elements like headers, navigation bars, lists, forms, etc.
- Each component type has specific fields or attributes that define its content or structure.
  
You can expand this JSON structure to include more pages, additional details, or different types of components based on the specific requirements of the application.
