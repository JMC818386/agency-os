## Visual Strategy

**Logo Prompt:** Create a modern, professional logo for the "Interstellar Logistics Command Center" project under the "DEEP_SPACE" initiative for the United Earth Trade Federation. Focus on minimalism and a vector style with a white background. Incorporate symbols of space logistics like orbital paths or asteroids, and include elements such as Helium-3 or rare earth elements. Aim for a sleek, futuristic look that conveys innovation and efficiency. Use a color palette inspired by "The Expanse" with Void Black, Safety Orange, Hull White, and Critical Red. Include monospaced typography to ensure clear readability.

**Mockup Prompt:** High-Fidelity Landing Page UI Mockup Prompt: "Create a high-fidelity UI mockup of a landing page for the Interstellar Logistics Command Center, focusing on a modern, clean, and Dribbble-style design for the hero section in dark mode. The page should feature a 2D top-down 'Orrery' map of the inner solar system, showing real-time shipping routes with interactive elements like cargo drone icons and orbital paths. Include sections for cargo manifest, fuel and physics calculator, and emergency protocols, each utilizing a color palette of Void Black, Safety Orange, Hull White, and Critical Red. Use monospaced fonts, like Roboto Mono, integrating micro-interactions such as CRT scanline effects. The overall design should evoke 'The Expanse' aesthetic, emphasizing utility, industrial efficacy, and futuristic elements. Ensure responsiveness with a clean, streamlined UI catered to a technologically-skilled audience managing interstellar logistics."
