Based on the given wireframe structure, we can generate a description for a visual mockup of the `Interstellar Logistics Command Center` application. Below is an elaboration, including suggestions for a theoretical design prompt or ASCII representation.

### Visual Mockups Description:

1. **Header:**
   - **Design:** The header is a sleek and modern navigation bar at the top of the application. It has a futuristic theme, utilizing a dark background (such as deep space black) with luminescent, contrasting text colors (such as white or light blue).
   - **Layout:** The navigation labels (Home, Orrery, Cargo, Calculators, Emergency) are spaced evenly from left to right, providing quick access to respective sections. A hover effect could add a subtle glow around each label to indicate interactivity.

2. **Main Content:**
   - **Orrery Visualization:**
     - **Map:** A dynamic map occupies the majority of the screen's real estate, showing a top-down view of space, with soft gradient blues and whites for planets and orbital paths.
     - **Icons:** Ships are marked by stylized vector icons that may resemble spacecraft silhouettes, with lines representing orbital paths.
     - **Interactivity:** Zoom-in and zoom-out buttons are located in a corner of the map, possibly depicted through +/- icons. When hovering over a ship icon, a tooltip with detailed information (such as velocity, manifest, and ETA) appears.
   
   - **Ship Details:**
     - **Design:** Information is displayed in a side panel or pop-out window using a simple, readable font, with headers slightly larger and bolder for emphasis.

   - **Cargo Manifest System:**
     - **Interface:** Contains a search bar at the top of a list view, with entries represented as cards or rows showing basic cargo information.
     - **Filter & Sort:** Dropdowns or button toggles allow for filtering by priority and sorting options. Filters can use distinct buttons or toggles.

   - **Fuel and Physics Calculator:**
     - **Form Inputs:** Arranged vertically, with clear labels (Current velocity, Fuel mass, Destination parameters) – inputs have a digital aesthetic, maybe with a soft glow or border.
     - **Results Display:** Calculated outputs (Delta-V, Safety margin, Optimal route) are displayed beneath, possibly in a distinct colored box to distinguish them.

   - **Emergency Protocols:**
     - **Modes:** A toggle button allows the switch between Standard and High-contrast modes. The High-contrast mode emphasizes red for critical details.
     - **Signals:** Buttons for sending SOS and securing communications are central, prominent, and colored in cautionary red or yellow for quick access.

3. **Footer:**
   - **Design:** Honors the high-tech theme but with a minimalist approach; essential links (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy) and contact information (email, phone) are organized into two columns.
