### Description:
- **Login Screen:** Users start at the login screen, where they enter credentials.
- **Dashboard:** Upon successful login, users are directed to the main dashboard, serving as the navigation hub.
  
#### Key User Options:
1. **The Orrery (Live Route Map):**
   - Users can view a live map showing spacecraft.
   - They can interact to see spacecraft details like manifests, velocity, and ETA.

2. **Cargo Manifest System:**
   - Users can filter and search cargo based on priority or type.
   - Detailed views of cargo manifests are accessible for deeper insights.

3. **Fuel & Physics Calculator:**
   - Users input ship details and trajectory to calculate required fuel.
   - Alerts are sent if calculations show insufficient fuel for a mission.

4. **Emergency Protocols:**
   - Engage "Red Alert" mode to switch the UI for emergencies.
   - Send encrypted SOS messages and verify the secure transmission of alerts.

- Users can navigate back to the dashboard after performing tasks within each module or log out to end their session.

This flow captures the major interactions and workflows envisioned for the DEEP_SPACE project, aligning with user tasks and objectives.
